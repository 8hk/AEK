# AEK
This project created for BOUN SWE 574 Course at Fall 2020. We are assigned as Team #2. 
Our [team members](https://github.com/8hk/AEK/wiki/Crew) are currently working as software engineers from different companies at Istanbul/Turkey. 

Project aims to search keywords provided by user at [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with using [Entrez API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/) and harvest the Entrez API result with using [Web Annotation Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and [UMLS API](https://documentation.uts.nlm.nih.gov/rest/search/index.html) to provide more reliable and intelligent search experience.

During the project we will document the project details under the [Wiki](https://github.com/8hk/AEK/wiki) section. If you have any question related to the project, please do not hesitate to contact a team member!
